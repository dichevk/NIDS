# Machine Learning - Security Assignment

## Installation and Requirements
This assignment uses Python 3 with [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/).

### Installing Jupyter Notebook
Also see [Jupyter Notebook - installation](http://jupyter.org/install)

Jupyter Notebook can be installed in two different ways, either by using Anaconda or pip. If you do not have Python 3 installed on your computer, we recommend installing through Anaconda as this will install all required packages in one go.

#### Installing Jupyter using Anaconda
Download Anaconda from the [Anaconda download page](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) and follow the instructions. The Anaconda package already includes all required Python libraries so they do not have to be installed separately.

#### Installing Jupyter with pip
Installing Jupyter with pip requires an installed version of Python 3.
```
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
python3 -m pip install jupyter
```

For solving the assignment we require several Python libraries, you can install these using
```
python3 -m pip install numpy pandas sklearn matplotlib requests
```

## Using the Jupyter Notebook
Also see [Running the Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/running.html).
Start the Jupyter Notebook from the command line:
```
jupyter notebook
```

You should see the notebook open in your browser. From here navigate to the `assignment_security.ipynb` file and open it. In each notebook you can write your Python code and execute it. Any output will be shown below the notebook codeblock that has been executed.
